Zilean is a service that allows you to search for [DebridMediaManager](https://github.com/debridmediamanager/debrid-media-manager) sourced content shared by users.
This can then be configured as a Torznab indexer in your favorite content application.
Newly added is the ability for Zilean to scrape from your running Zurg instance, and from other running Zilean instances.
